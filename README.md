# bsonbox
**bsonbox** is a BSON (binary json) -generator, -parser and -toolbox.
The code has been lifted from https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver
because I wanted a library (json, msgpack or bson) that is simple, robust,
dependency-free and, **most importantly**, that will not see breaking revisions.
